# What is this
Small addon script for Kodi to launch the VM. 
My PC is basically rebuilt to be a Kodi media center, but with gaming.
A similar addon starts Steam.

# Installation
Compress this folder to a zip file.
In Kodi, go to Addons. Somewhere, there is an option to select an addon from a zip file, then select the zip file.
